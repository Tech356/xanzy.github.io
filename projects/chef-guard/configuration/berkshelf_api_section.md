For this you can use the community endpoint at <https://supermarket.getchef.com> or you can use a locally installed and configured version of the Berkshelf API. We suggest jumping through the hoops of installing your own Berkshelf API server, so you have a means to have all your private cookbooks right allongside the community cookbooks into one big index. This is by far the fastest and most reliable way of searching for existing private and community cookbook/version combinations.
