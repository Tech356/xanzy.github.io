### Configuration Changes Workflow
The introduction section about [Monitoring/Auditing]({{ side.url }}/projects/chef-guard/introduction/monitoring_auditing.html) gives a nice overview of the monitoring and auditing capabilities of Chef-Guard and describes the configurable part of the workflow that takes place when you make changes to a Chef object. To put things in perspective and to better explain the impact of the configuration choices on the workflow, we tried to visualize all the steps in a single flowchart. Hopefully this will make understanding and troubleshooting the workflow a lot easier.

_NOTE: The blue boxes all contain configurable features!_
