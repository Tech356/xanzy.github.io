### Workflows
You can configure (by enabling or disabling certain features) the workflows that you enforce by using Chef-Guard. To better explain the workflows and the impact your configuration choices have on them, we've put in a couple of flowcharts.

With these we tried to visualize all the steps in a workflow including the possible impact of the features you can configure. Hopefully this will make understanding and troubleshooting the workflows a lot easier.

Currently we have the following workflows:

- [Configuration Changes]({{ side.url }}/projects/chef-guard/workflows/configuration_changes.html)
- [Cookbook Upload]({{ side.url }}/projects/chef-guard/workflows/cookbook_upload.html)
